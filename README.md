# AstroHack - Tensorflow + Keras Example

A tutorial that demonstrates how to predict galaxy M/L ratios using a simple convolutional neural network with the Keras API of TensorFlow 2.0.

This tutorial is written and tested with Python 3.6.

**Steps**

1. Download AstroHack data files and place/unzip them in the `./data` folder
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the `astrohack_tf_example.ipynb` notebook with Jupyter.
